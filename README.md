Week 1 hmwrk:
I change the website title, and organized the HTML some more, and added the spacing inbetween sections of the HTML. For the CSS, I deleted some sections of the CSS that seemed to be duplicates and I merge some of the CSS sections together. 

Week 2 Hmwrk:
With this homework, I set down the html base for all three pages before I decided what type of layout I wanted from bootstrap. Each of my page has a different grid system and figuring out how to work each one was a challenge. I did had fun learning the layouts though and figuring out where and how to put each one for the spacing and such. I think I had the hardest time figuring out the layout for the Contact page, however making the About Me and Portfolio was enjoyable to me.
